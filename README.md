This is a project I was reviewed on a freelance basis for Jetbrains Academy's Python track.

The objective of this project was to use the Django REST API framework to create a REST API for color calculations. The API has functions for increasing/decreasing the saturation of a color expressed in HSV format, converting between HSV, RGB, HEX, and HSL formats, and finally for calculating complementary colors to an input color.
